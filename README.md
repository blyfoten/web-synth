# Web-Synth with Just Intonation

**[üéπ Try it now!](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/blyfoten/web-synth/raw/refs/heads/main/index.html)**

A simple web-based synthesizer that can be played directly in the browser. 
It uses the Web Audio API to generate sound and offers basic features for exploring different tuning systems:

## üéπ Features

### Keyboard
- **Simple keyboard** with one octave (7 white + 5 black keys)
- **Polyphony** - play multiple notes simultaneously
- **Touch/Mouse support** - works on most devices
- **Sliding/Glissando** - hold down a key and slide between others for smooth transitions
- **Visual feedback** - active keys are highlighted

### Tuning
- **Equal Temperament** - standard Western tuning
- **Just Intonation** - pure tuning with mathematically perfect intervals
- **Key selection** - choose root note for Just Intonation
- **Real-time switching** - switch between tunings while playing

### Sound Shaping
- **Waveforms**: Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Square
- **ADSR envelope**: Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release
- **Filter**: Low-pass with cutoff & resonance
- **Delay**: Mix, time, feedback
- **Reverb**: Mix, decay time, room-size, pre-delay
- **Volume control**

### Oscilloscope
- **Triggered visualization** - stable, synchronized waveform display
- **C-referenced time** - shows exactly 2 C wavelengths for comparison
- **Color coding** - each note has its own color
- **Real-time updates** - see differences between Equal and Just intonation

## üéµ Usage

### Basic playing
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
2. Click or tap keys to play notes
3. Use multiple fingers for polyphony

### Advanced techniques
- **Sliding**: Hold down a key and slide between others for glissando effects
- **Tuning comparison**: Switch between Equal and Just to hear differences
- **Key exploration**: Change root note in Just mode for different intervals
- **PANIC button**: Stop all notes immediately

### Sound shaping
- **Waveform**: Choose between different oscillators for different timbres
- **Filter**: Shape the sound with cutoff and resonance
- **Envelope**: Control attack and release for different articulations
- **Effects**: Add delay and reverb for depth and space

## üîß Technical Details

### Tuning Systems
- **Equal Temperament**: 12-tone equal temperament (2^(1/12))
- **Just Intonation**: 5-limit pure tuning with perfect intervals
- **Intervals**: Unison (1:1), Minor Second (16:15), Major Second (9:8), Minor Third (6:5), Major Third (5:4), Perfect Fourth (4:3), Tritone (45:32), Perfect Fifth (3:2), Minor Sixth (8:5), Major Sixth (5:3), Minor Seventh (9:5), Major Seventh (15:8)

### Oscilloscope
- **Trigger**: Synchronizes all waveforms to upward zero crossing
- **Time window**: Shows exactly 2 C wavelengths for consistent reference
- **Phase comparison**: Shows phase differences between intervals in different tunings

### Web Audio API
- **Oscillators**: Real-time sound generation
- **Filter**: BiquadFilter for sound shaping
- **Effects**: Delay and Convolver for reverb
- **Analysis**: FFT for waveform visualization

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `index.html` ‚Äì Complete application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- `README.md` ‚Äì This documentation

The project is completely self-contained and requires no server or external dependencies.

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Music education**: Understand differences between tuning systems
- **Composition**: Explore just intonation for new timbres
- **Experimentation**: Test different sound shaping and effects
- **Learning**: Simple way to explore Web Audio API concepts

## üîÆ Future Ideas

- MIDI support for external controllers
- More waveforms and sound modules
- Preset system for sound settings
- Recording and export functions
- More tuning systems (Pythagorean, Meantone, etc.)
